      <description>Introduction Perhaps the most ubiquitous type of geographic information is the continuous stream of data produced by GPS devices. Global Positioning System (GPS) devices are now in everything from watches to cars and, of course, smartphones. This means that GPS datasets have the ability to track a large proportion of the worldâ€™s population. Although there are privacy concerns, when appropriately anonymized and aggregated, GPS datasets have the potential to help tackle the issues raised in the Transportation chapter of the Geocomputation with R book: to design healthy transport systems in which walking and cycling overtake cars as the main travel modes.</description>
