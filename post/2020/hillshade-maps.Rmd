This vignette builds on the [making maps chapter](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html) of [the Geocomputation with R book](https://geocompr.github.io/).

## Prerequisites {-}

The example below assume the following packages are attached:

```{r}
library(raster) # data download
library(tmap)   # map creation
```

# Hillshade map

Hillshade maps show the topographical shape of hills and mountains using levels of gray on a map.
The role of this kind of maps is to display relative slopes, but not absolute height.

## Calculate terrain characteristics 

Elevation data is needed to create a hillshade map.
The **raster** package provides an easy access to the SRTM 90 m resolution elevation data with the `getData()` function.
For example, it is possible to download the elevation data for the whole country of Slovenia using the code below:

```{r}
alt = getData("alt", country = "SVN", path = tempdir())
```

Hillshade maps are created based on certain terrain characteristics - slope and aspect.
Slope represents the steepness at each cell of a raster surface.
The lower the slope value - the flatter the terrain.
Aspect is the direction of the maximum slope of the focal cell.
Slope and aspect can be calculated with the `terrain` function and the `opt` argument set to `"slope"` or `"aspect"`.
Both values are returned in radians by default.

```{r}
slope = terrain(alt, opt = "slope")
aspect = terrain(alt, opt = "aspect")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
t_slope = tm_shape(slope) + tm_raster(style = "cont") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
t_aspect = tm_shape(aspect) + tm_raster(style = "cont") + 
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
tmap_arrange(t_slope, t_aspect, nrow = 1)
```

<!-- add plots of slope and as pect -->
<!-- explain what's that  -->

Computing of a hillshade can be done using the `hillShade()` function. 
It requires previously created `slope` and `aspect` objects and setting two new arguments `angle` and `direction`.
The `angle` argument is the elevation angle of the light source and the `direction` argument is the direction (azimuth) angle of the light source (sun), both in degrees.

```{r}
hill = hillShade(slope, aspect, angle = 40, direction = 270)
```

The output object can be plotted with `plot(hill)`, however, it does not give an expected map.
This is because the hillshade object should be overlayed by another semi-transparent layer to give a proper visualization.

## Create a hillshade map

A hillshade map can be created using the **tmap** package.
This package builds maps by stacking different data layers.
In this case, the first layer is the hillshade object (`hill`), colored using different levels of gray.

```{r}
tm_shape(hill) +
  tm_raster(palette = gray(0:10 / 10), style = "cont", legend.show = FALSE)
```

The second layer is the elevation object (`alt`), colored using the `terrain.colors` palette.

```{r}
tm_shape(alt) +
  tm_raster(alpha = 0.5, palette = terrain.colors(10), style = "cont",
            title = "Elevation (m asl)", legend.show = TRUE)
```

Finally, both layers can be combined to create an expected visualization.
It could be also improved by placing the legend on the right bottom of the map.

```{r, fig.width=6}
tm_shape(hill) +
  tm_raster(palette = gray(0:10 / 10), style = "cont", legend.show = FALSE) +
  tm_shape(alt) +
  tm_raster(alpha = 0.5, palette = terrain.colors(10), style = "cont",
            title = "Elevation (m asl)", legend.show = TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("RIGHT", "BOTTOM"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# https://github.com/neilcharles/geoviz
library(magrittr)
library(rayshader)

alt2 = projectRaster(alt, crs = "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=15 +k=0.9999 +x_0=500000 +y_0=-5000000 +ellps=bessel +towgs84=682,-203,480,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs")

raster_template = raster(extent(alt2), resolution = 1000, crs = crs(alt2))

alt3 = resample(alt2, raster_template)

elevation_mat = t(raster::as.matrix(alt3))
shadow_mat = ray_shade(elevation_mat)

elevation_mat %>%
  sphere_shade(progbar = FALSE, sunangle = 45) %>%
  add_shadow(shadow_mat)%>%
   plot_map() # %>%
  plot_3d(elevation_mat,
          zscale = 75,
          phi = 30,
          theta = 135)
```
