## What is R?

"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. Among other things it has

- an effective data handling and storage facility
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or on hardcopy, and
- a well developed, simple and effective programming language [with] conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output"

R Core Team (2019)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help.start() # get started with R, from in R!
```

## Y R?

Start with broader questions:

- Why use a programming language at all?

- Because it allows you to do more things than monolithic programs driven by a graphical user interface (GUI) such as Microsoft Excel and ESRI's ArcMap.

- Why use a command-line interface (CLI)?

- It lets you get things done faster (once you learn the workflow)
- Scalability, e.g. the Propensity to Cycle Tool ([PCT](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2019)
- Reproducibility

## Which language?

--


.pull-left[

- Large user community

- In your area of work

- Spatial, temporal and modelling capabilities

- Visualisation and statistical analysis

]

.pull-right[


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://stackoverflow.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tag_growth_scatter-1-771x675.png")

## An introduction to R's syntax

Everything that 'exists' is an object

---

## Assignment and style

```{r}
x = 1  # 'quals assignment'
x <- 1 # arrow assignment
```

Which to use?

--

It's a matter of style

--


```{r, results='hide'}
system.time(y <- sqrt(1:1e6))
system.time({y = sqrt(1:1e6)})
```

- Assignment inside function call

--

- Good, consistent style helps communicate your work:

```{r}
sQuare_RootdeC=quantile(y,seq(0,1,0.1))   # bad
sqrt_deciles = quantile(y, probs = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)) # good
```

---

# Vectors

- Creating vectors with `c()`

```{r}
person_name = c("arron", "bob", "carl")
n_coffee = c(5, 1, 0)
likes_herbal_tea = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
home_region = c("west-yorkshire", "avon", "london")
```

- R is vectorised

```{r}
is.vector(person_name)
is.vector(1)
```

---

## Vector classes

What is their class?

```{r}
class(person_name)
class(n_coffee)
```

--

What class is `likes_herbal_tea`?

---

## Class coercion

```{r}
n_coffee # print the object
```


```{r}
n_coffee_char = as.character(n_coffee)
```

```{r}
n_coffee_char
```


```{r}
person_name_numeric = as.numeric(person_name)
person_name_numeric
```

---

## Vector subsetting

```{r}
person_name[2]
person_name[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

--

Recycling

```{r}
person_name[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
```

--

What just happened?

---

## Data frames

The most common and useful object type for many applications

```{r}
coffee_df = data.frame(
  person_name,
  n_coffee,
  likes_herbal_tea,
  home_region
  )
coffee_df
class(coffee_df)
```


---

## tibbles

```{r, echo=TRUE}
coffee = tibble::tibble(
  person_name,
  n_coffee,
  likes_herbal_tea,
  home_region
  )
coffee
class(coffee)
```

---

## Data frame operations - rows

```{r}
coffee[2, ]
dplyr::slice(coffee, 2)
coffee[coffee$likes_herbal_tea, ]
```

---

## Data fram operations - columns

```{r}
coffee[, 2]
dplyr::select(coffee, n_coffee)
coffee$n_coffee
```



---

## Functions

Everything that happens is a function

Functions take arguments


```{r}
quantile(n_coffee)
quantile(n_coffee, probs = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9))
# ?quantile # get help!
quantile(n_coffee, names = FALSE)
```


---

## Base R plots

```{r}
plot(coffee$n_coffee)
```

---

## Next steps and getting help

- R is a language - needs practice

- Frequent use of R's help is recommended, e.g. with `?plot()`

- Check-out online communities such as StackOverflow and the RStudio community
